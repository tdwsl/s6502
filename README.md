ABOUT

s6502 is a simple emulator for the 6502 proccessor. It isn't cycle-acurate,
and it doesn't support illegal opcodes, but aside from that it works fine.
It is intended to be used as a library in a C program. Examples have been
included.

COMPILING

Just add the source and header files to a project and compile as usual -
s6502 uses the standard library, so it should be compatible with most modern
compilers.
